<!--
**ArlindPestisha/ArlindPestisha** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile. -->

In a former life, I was a Team Leader, Project Manager, Sales, Marketing Manager, and Social Media
Manager. Today, I am an avid learner and a Software developer and now am looking for a job.


Exercising team building and working with distributed teams and using creativity is what makes me tick. I'm motivated by the opportunity to create meaningful experiences.

I also use a creative and flexible approach to problem-solving and do my best to bring new perspectives to any team or environment I find myself in.

I'm interested in both Development and Product Management and want my skills in both to complement each other.

âš¡ Fun fact: If you have said to me 4 years before that I am going to be a software developer I would have laughed in your face very hard and said to you 'are you crazy or what?' but now I love everything about tech and software!
